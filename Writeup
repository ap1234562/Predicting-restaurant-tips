Predicting restaurant tips using predictive analytics means analyzing data to identify patterns and build a prediction model 

that forecasts tip amounts based on factors like Total bill, size, time of day, day of the week, etc.

By using statistical tools like correlation, regression, moving averages, etc. 

a restaurant can gain insights into factors that affect tips and make data-driven decisions, potentially improving service and revenue.

This dataset typically includes variables such as total bill, tip amount, customer gender, smoker status, day, time (lunch or dinner), and party size.

Here, Categorical variables are encoded numerically with IF condition (e.g., 0 for female and 1 for male) to make them compatible. It as follows:
•	Sex (0 for female, 1 for male)

•	Smoker (0 for non-smokers, 1 for smokers)

•	Day (e.g., Thur, Fri, Sat, Sun), as 1

•	Time (0 for dinner, 1 for lunch)

Correlation measures the relationship between two variables, showing whether they increase or decrease together. 

Correlation Coefficient (r): Ranges from -1 to +1(+1: Perfect positive correlation and     -1: Perfect negative correlation).

In this predictive analytics, correlation helps to identify which factors are most related to the target variable that is the tip amount.

It suggests that total bills and size has a high positive correlation with Tips which indicate that larger bills and party size tend to result in larger tips.

Covariance measures how two variables vary together, indicating the direction of their relationship but not its strength.

Positive Covariance Indicates that as one variable increases, the other also tends to increase. For instance, 

a positive covariance between Total Bill and Tip means higher bills are generally associated with higher tips.

A Moving Average is a technical tool used to make it easier to observe underlying trends over time.

Here, percentages for tips relative to total bills, includes a moving average, likely to smooth variations and observe tipping trends over time. 

A moving average can help identify tipping trends and patterns across different time periods, such as days, weeks. etc. It also shows a moving average chart trends over time.

Regression focuses on building a model to predict tip amounts based on the variables. 

Residual means the difference between the actual tip(1.01) and the predicted tip(2.62), representing(-1.61) the model’s error for each observation.

Multiple R represents the correlation between the actual and predicted values. By applying CORREL function(=correl(array1,array2) will give 0.68.  

A higher value suggests a stronger relationship. For example here, Multiple R of 0.68 suggests that 68% of the variability in tips is explained by the model.

R Square: This metric, also known as the coefficient of determination, indicates the proportion of variability in the tip amount explained by the model’s predictors. 

For example, an R Square of 0.46  suggests that 46% of the variability in tips is explained by the model.

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) is a common metric in regression analysis that measures the average magnitude of the prediction errors. 

Here, RMSE tells us how far the predicted tip amounts are from the actual tips.

The RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) for the regression model is approximately 1.007. This means that, on average, the model's predictions for tips deviate from the actual tips by about 1.007 units.

The variables size and total bill are statistically significant, suggesting that these two variables have a meaningful impact on predicting tips.
